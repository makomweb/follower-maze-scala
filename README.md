## Prerequisites

The implementation was done using SCALA with the following tools:

Run the Scala Build Tools to execute individual tasks:

```

or

```
java -jar .\target\scala-2.12\follower-maze-scala_2.12-0.1.jar

The implementation was made on a Windows 10 notebook and I tested it on an EC2 AWS instance running Linux.
